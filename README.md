# rSPL : A Typsesafe Relational Extension of simPL

This project develops a domain specific language, `rSPL`, which is an
extension of `simPL`. `simPL` is an `OCaml` based language developed by the
Programming Language Design and Implementation course staff (YSC3208).

`rSPL` includes relational operations similar to those found in database
querying languages like SQL.
